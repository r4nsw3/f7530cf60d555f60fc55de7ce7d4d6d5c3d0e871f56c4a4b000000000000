  |   As of February 13th, 2019, you can purchase the Captain Toad:         |
  |   Treasure Tracker - Special Episode DLC to continue your journey       |
  |   with eighteen new challenges, including five brand-new courses.       |
  |   Purchase and download this content before March 14th for early        |
  |   access to one of the courses! The remainder of the DLC will be        |
  |   available on March 14th. Naturally, you can play all of the courses   |
  |   with a friend or alone. Either way, you'll dodge dangers and track    |
  |   treasures across many trap-filled miniature worlds; some are even     |
  |   based on the Super Mario Odyssey game!                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Captain Toad stars in his own puzzling quest on the Nintendo Switch   |
  |   system! Our stubby hero must dodge dangers and track treasures        |
  |   across many trap-filled courses. Survive smoldering volcanoes,        |
  |   hazardous steam engines, haunted houses, and even new courses based   |
  |   on the Super Mario Odyssey game! Luckily, a second player can join    |
  |   in by tossing turnips at enemies.                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Play anytime, anywhere, and anyway you want - even in two-player      |
  |   mode using a pair of Joy-Con controllers on one Nintendo Switch       |
  |   system - in TV mode or Tabletop mode. You could also play alone in    |
  |   handheld mode! No matter what, explore each puzzling course for       |
  |   treasure, like hidden Super Gems and Power Stars. As you reclaim      |
  |   the treasure stolen by the monstrous, greedy bird, Wingo, you'll      |
  |   eventually be able to play as Toadette! These tiny heroes must        |
  |   waddle, hide, pluck, chuck, and power-up through enemy-infested       |
  |   locales like towers, wild-west shanties, and Goomba waterparks -      |
  |   all bursting with secrets. Aim your head-mounted flashlight at        |
  |   adventure!                                                            |
